ðŸ”¹ Customer Churn Prediction using ANN

Description:

This repository contains an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for predicting customer churn. 
The dataset includes various customer attributes such as credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, and activity status to determine whether a customer is likely to leave the service.


The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras with multiple hidden layers, ReLU activation for hidden layers, and sigmoid activation for binary classification. 
Techniques like Dropout regularization, early stopping, and Adam optimizer are used to enhance performance.

Features:

âœ… Data Preprocessing: Encoding categorical data, feature scaling

âœ… ANN Model: Multi-layer perceptron with dropout for regularization

âœ… Optimization: Adam optimizer with a manually adjustable learning rate

âœ… Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, loss monitoring, confusion matrix, ROC curve

âœ… Early Stopping: Prevents overfitting by monitoring validation loss
