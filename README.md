Customer Churn Prediction Model ðŸš€

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts customer churn based on various demographic, financial, and activity-related factors. The dataset includes key customer details such as credit score, geography, age, account balance, and transaction behavior.

ðŸ“Œ Features & Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of 14 columns, where the target variable is Exited (1 = Churned, 0 = Retained).

RowNumber, CustomerId, Surname â†’ Unique identifiers (not used in modeling).
CreditScore â†’ A customer's credit rating.
Geography â†’ Country of residence.
Gender â†’ Male/Female.
Age â†’ Customer's age.
Tenure â†’ Number of years with the bank.
Balance â†’ Account balance.
NumOfProducts â†’ Number of products the customer holds.
HasCrCard â†’ Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
IsActiveMember â†’ Whether the customer is an active bank member (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
EstimatedSalary â†’ Estimated annual income.
Exited â†’ Target variable (1 = Churned, 0 = Retained).
ðŸ“Š Machine Learning Approach
Preprocessing: Data cleaning, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
Models Used: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC Curve.
ðŸ”§ Installation & Usage
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/abhijeeth12/Customer-Churn-Prediction.git
cd Customer-Churn-Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
python churn_model.py
ðŸ“œ Results & Insights
Customers with higher ages and lower activity levels are more likely to churn.
Having multiple bank products and a higher credit score reduces churn probability.
